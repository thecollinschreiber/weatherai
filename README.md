# Weather AI

A Semester Project for COSC 2436 at South Texas College.

This project was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I used the openweathermap.org API to get current weather information and used netlify to deploy the app. 

In the future I'd like to implement chatGPT into the app, as well as find an updated API to use.
